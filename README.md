# European-Football-Player-Clustering

The methodology employed involved a twofold process centered around an unsupervised learning approach. Primarily, K-Means clustering was conducted on the dataset in order to find clusters of players which were statistically similar. Second, cosine similarity was implemented on the players which were clustered together, so that an additional measure was taken to identify players most similar to one another. Cosine similarity also provided a means of which to quantifiably compare certain players to one another and detect just how similar certain players are to one another.
